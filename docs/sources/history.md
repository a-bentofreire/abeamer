## History

In 2016, after more than 20 years away from UNIX systems, I have embraced Linux OS again.  
At the time, I was working on a project that required generate video overlays from large
quantities text pieces, and I didn't found any open-source that could easily to the job.  
Visual Video Editors required to add text by text, python PIL didn't allow complex text effects,
JQuery and Velocity didn't allow to animate frame by frame, and using screen capture programs didn't guarantee to capture each frame, nor provided transparent backgrounds.  
To solve the problem, I had to create a mix of tools from different computer languages using a myriad of technologies.  
The final solution solved the problem, but it was such a patchwork and became too time-consuming to maintain it.

In 2018, I took a long breath of air, and decided to transform one of the tools I created in 2016, into a complete framework that would be able to solve all the problems, avoiding a patchwork, and publish it as open-source.  
Along the process, I faced several obstacles due the way technology is built today, but in the process, I learned all the possibilities that such technology could bring, mainly the remote rending possibility.  

I hope the final result is able to go far beyond in what the original project was supposed to be.  
How far it can go? Only the time will tell.
