# Description

When contributing to the open-source community, developers many times end up being
in the receiving end of everyone who _forgot the put garbage in the bin before leaving home_.  
  
To keep an healthy developing environment, it's strictly banned:  

- B01. All forms of harassment.   
- B02. Abusive language.   
- B02. Comments that undervalue other's people work or character.   
- B03. Inflated ego comments.   
- B04. Confined space solutions, alas any comment that is only applied to a certain region,
status quo, wealth or human language.   
  
Anyone who transgresses these rules, risks itself of having his post or work removed 
and banned from future interactions.

## Reporting bugs

To prevent any kind of friction with the developers, keep it simple and use following template:  


> Under these circumstances.  
> (Version/OS/etc...)  
>  
>This issue occurs:  
>(Describe the issue)  

Reporting problems without defining the circumstances can lead to a long process 
of discovering, which will delay the solution.
