## [1.5.0] -
### Changed
- (DEV) Port documents build to mkdocs 1.0.1.
- Improve the gallery example descriptions.
- Improve of a few cosmetic steps of the `build gallery-release`.
- Fix broken links, documentation formating and its output.
  > The output documentation code syntax highlight is changed to javascript due
  > the fact the highligher processor performs better.  
  > The website scripts will be responsible to improve the code highlight output.  
- (DEV) Remove dead code. Add missing void return type.
- (DEV) Remove local build-docs.
  > By moving the docs and gallery to the same domain as the website and blog,
  > and by restructuring the docs and gallery output paths to be the same as online,
  > now it's possible to test the docs and gallery offline using a local server and symlinks.  
- Improve command line documentation.
- (DEV) Move build paths, urls and parts of gulp code to `config.yaml`.
  > With this change, a developer can change the release paths and execute gulp tasks
  > without changing the gulpfile. There are still parts inside the gulp file that needs to
  > be ported.  
- (DEV) Change gulp task, npm scripts, code naming to match path names of release,gallery and docs.
  > With this change, the gulp tasks, builder filenames are easier to understand
  > its meaning since they match the output path names.  
- (DEV) Change main gulp tasks into gulpSequence.
  > Instead of chaining gulp tasks with the required finished tasks and having parts of the tasks
  > in the `package.json` file. the external gulp tasks use a gulpSequence which is much easier to
  > read the workflow.  

### Fixed
- Fix the removal of export of ids starting with `_` during build process of a single file.
  > This bug was introduced just before the commit 5f4f3e6. In practice, the
  > committed code didn't remove the exports of the ids starting with `_`.  
  > There was no side-effects just had no effect.  
  > Also added `_vars` to the list of exclusions of this process since
  > it's still being used by chart tasks.  
- Fix minor design issues in 2 `gallery-src` examples.

### Added
- Add Minor cosmetic improvements on gallery README.
- (DEV) Add `gulp post-build-docs` to improve documentation output.
  > This version replaces documentation online links with local links
  > to support offline testing.  
- Add type and keyword syntax highlighting code during `post-build-docs`.
- Add `allowExpr` parameter to `add-vars` task.
  > When `allowExpr` is true, and the value is string starting with `=`,
  > it will compute the expression, using ABeamer expression parser.  
- Add `datetime-functions` plugin.
  > This plugin allows to create teleportable expressions with date/time functions.  
- (DEV) Add `_` to the start of the id of unused function parameters. 
  > Although the tsconfig.json has `"noUnusedParameters": false`,  
  > adding the underscore prevent warnings in case of is set to `true`,  
  > and also helps to understand better unused parameters for future cleanups.  
- Add support for array parameters to rgb functions in `color-functions` plugin.
- Add `hsl` and `hsla` functions to `color-functions` plugin.
- Add `abs` and `sign` functions to `functions`.
- Add `hsl2Rgb` and `rgb2Hsl` functions to `color-functions` plugin.
- Add alternative ways to express colors to `gallery-src/animate-colors`.
  > Originally it was designed, only to use color arrays,
  > but this addition, the user can also test expressions with rgb/hsl functions.  


## [1.4.0] -
### Fixed
- Fix the bug in `gulp build-release` that forced to have 2 folders in the gallery.

### Added
- Add abeamer-debug.min.js to release version and both min.js are smaller.
  > To generate the release version, all core .ts files are joined and
  >  it's removed the inner namespaces and removed the exports from id starting with `_`.  
  > Then they are compiled again using tsc.  
  > This process makes the minify compress more since there more internal symbols.  
  > The abeamer.min takes one step further by stripping all the code
  > inside #debug-start/#debug-end section.  
  > This will remove its capacity to provide debug logs but it will make it lighter.  
- Add `story.startTeleporting` to delay the teleportation initial snapshot.
  > This new method allows to teleport any HTML/CSS code injected
  > after the story has been created and before this method was invoked.
  > Read more on https://abeamer.devtoix.com/blog/2018/08/20/how-to-delay-the-teleportation-in-abeamer.html

### Changed
- Move gallery, badges, icons file paths to be compatible with the website.
  > This change moves not only the file structure but also updates all the build scripts.  
  > With this change, it simplifies the process of local testing
  > and converting from local links to online links back and forth.  
  > Information regarding the old repos and git pages is removed.  
  > Documentation links are also updated to reflect this change.  
  >
  > File structure changes:
  >
  > - gallery -> gallery-src
  > - gallery-release -> gallery/latest
  > - docs/sources/*.{svg,gif} -> assets/badges
  > - docs/sources/*.png -> assets/icons
- Change the background image of `animate-item-delay` to reduce the pixelization.
  > When it was converted to animated gif the image looked pixelized due the fact
  > there is a color reduction to 256-colors and the previous background image add
  > too many shades.  


## [1.3.0] -
### Fixed
- Fix font rendering bug in `animate-transitions` example.
  > The problem was due a bug in Chrome as described in:
  > http://abeamer.devtoix.com/blog/2018/08/15/abeamer-1.3.0-released.html

## [1.2.0] -
### Fixed
- Change imagemagick `convert` alpha parameters to fix gif generation on windows.

### Changed
- Remove `docs` and `gallery-release` visual customization.
  > Since the website, blog, release, and gallery-release are all hosted by the abeamer.devtoix.com
  > website, this is now in responsibility to do all the customization.  
- Change the release version from release to `release/latest`.
  > This change will allow a local webserver have access to the same
  > url subpart as it is on the abeamer.devtoix.com site.  
  > Simplifying the process of testing and deploying release versions.  
- Add minify to all js files during the `build-release` phase.

### Changed
- Move documentation from github repo to https://abeamer.devtoix.com/docs.
- Update links and generators to move docs, gallery and release to abeamer website.
  > The github repos are replaced with folders on https://abeamer.devtoix.com.  
  >
  > - docs/build/(target)/versions/latest/en ----> docs/release/latest/(target)/en
  > - git repo abeamer-release ----> release/latest
  > - git repo abeamer-gallery-release ----> gallery/latest
  > - git repo abeamer-docs ----> docs/latest
- Remove `index-online.html` from `gallery/*/code.zip`.
  > This file will be integrated with the website and shouldn't be part of user files.  

### Added
- Add parameter `--gif-background` to `abeamer gif` CLI.
- (DEV) `gulp build-gallery-release` generate index.html.
  > Since abeamer.devtoix.com doesn't support markdown render, it's required to generate the index.html
- Add `messages/messages-en.js` to be the version 2.x holder of the english messages.
  > The messages in i18n.ts file will be moved to messages/messages-en.ts file on version 2.x.  
  > Users are encouraged to include the messages/messages-en.js on their index.html
  > even though for now it's an empty file to prevent breaking changes.  
- Add core plugins to gallery examples using oscillators, paths, transitions and functions.
- (DEV) Add check for missing gif files on `gulp build-gallery-release`.
- Add abeamer scripts to abeamer-release.zip.
  > This addition allows users how just want to download abeamer as a zip instead of using
  > npm to have running scripts without having to build their own scripts.  

## [1.1.0] -
### Changed
- Access to `story.virtualAnimator` is deprecated.
  > use `addVirtualAnimator`/`removeVirtualAnimator` instead.  
- (DEV) Port `_ChartVirtualAnimator` to `SimpleVirtualAnimator`.
  > Using `SimpleVirtualAnimator` gives a cleaner implementation, and by also using
  > `animateProps` reduces the render count when the animator has multiple animation properties.  

### Added
- Add `addVirtualAnimator`/`removeVirtualAnimator` to the story.
  > By using these methods instead of direct access to `virtualAnimator`,
  > allows to create maps for quicker access to virtual animators.
- Add `SimpleVirtualAnimator` class.
  > To be used by plugin creators to simplify the process of animating their content.
- Add support value parameters starting with -- in the abeamer cli.
- Add `--movie-pre` and `--movie-post` parameters to abeamer cli.
  > These arguments to be passed to ffmpeg before/after the arguments passed by abeamer.
- Add `--gif-pre` and `--gif-post` parameters to abeamer cli.
  > These arguments to be passed to convert before/after the arguments passed by abeamer.
- (DEV) Add `Launch abeamer cli` to VSC debugger configuration.
- (DEV) Add excludes to vsc files.watcher
  > VSC complains about too many files on the project.  
  > This change is an attempt to solve this issue.  
- Add support of system env FFMPEG_BIN to locate ffmpeg executable.
  > By having an environment variable pointing to the ffmpeg executable,
  > ABeamer can generate a movie without requiring ffmpeg to be in the search path.  
- Add support of system env IM_CONVERT_BIN to locate imagemagick convert executable.
  > By having an environment variable pointing to the imagemagick convert executable,
  > ABeamer can generate a gif without requiring imagemagick convert to be in the search path.  
  > On windows the search path points to windows convert program which can conflict with imagemagick convert.  
- Add `check` command to the abeamer cli.
  > Gives the user information how to configure `puppeteer` to use `Chrome` instead of `Chromium`.  
- (DEV) Add windows test batch files.
  > It helps windows developers to test developer versions.  
- Add adapters.frameRendered.
  > Using `frameRendered` allows animators with multiple animation properties
  > to be called only once per frame. This is the case of charts and
  > many other common canvas and WebGL virtual animators.  
- Add SimpleVirtualAnimator.animateProps.
- Prepare core parts to be moved into plugins on version 2.x.
  > By having many core parts as plugins, the ABeamer will load faster
  > and the user can opt-out parts that aren't needed in a project.  
  > Since this will generate breaking changes,
  > this phase will only be a preparation.

### Fix
- Fix http-server for URL with path with %20(spaces).
- (DEV) Fix unix test scripts project paths containing spaces.
- Fix render plugin injector to apply the same url base part.
  > This allows the dev script teleport.sh to inject on non-release version,
  > and in the release version to correctly inject in case the user changed from abeamer
  > to another path.  
- (DEV) Fix unix test script teleport.sh project paths containing spaces.

## [1.0.1] -
